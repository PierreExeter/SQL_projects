# SQL Scripts for Data Analysis

This repository contains SQL scripts for data cleaning and exploratory analysis across diverse datasets, including customer data, global life expectancy, and US household income. 

**Tools Used**
- MySQL 8.0.43
- MySQL Workbench 8.0

**Key Features**
- Data cleaning : duplicate removal, format standardization, missing value imputation, columns splitting.
- Exploratory Data Analysis : identify trends and correlations.
- Automated data cleaning via stored procedures and scheduled events.

Ideal for learning SQL-based data preparation and analysis workflows.


## Customer Data Cleaning

```
1_customer_data_cleaning.sql
```

Data cleaning is the foundational step in any data analysis process. This project demonstrates SQL techniques to prepare customer dataâ€”removing duplicates, filling missing values, standardizing formats, and splitting columns for better usability.

## World Life Expectancy

```
2_world_life_expectancy.sql
```

![Alt Text](img/world_life_expectancy.png)

This SQL script cleans global life expectancy data by removing duplicates and imputing missing values. Key insights from the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) include:
- Haiti and Zimbabwe saw the highest 15-year life expectancy gains.
- Global life expectancy rises steadily each year.
- Wealthier and developed nations tend to have a higher life expectancy.
- Higher BMI correlates with longer lifespans.


## US Household Income

```
3_US_household_income.sql
```

This project cleans and analyzes US household income data by state and city, revealing key trends:
- Geography: Texas & California lead in land area; Michigan has the most water.
- Income disparities: The top/bottom 10 states show stark contrasts in household income.
- There is an uneven distribution of household income in wealthier regions.
- Urban divide: Municipal residents earn more, while urban/community incomes lag significantly.


## Automated Data Cleaning

```
4_automated_data_cleaner.sql
```

This project automates data cleaning using SQL: a stored procedure creates a sanitized table, processes raw data, adds timestamps, and aggregates results. A scheduled event triggers this pipeline every 30 days for maintenance-free updates.
